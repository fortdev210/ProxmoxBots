## How it works

When there are some orders from Amazon, an admin has to manually make order on supplier website using customer's info (first name, last name...). This Chrome extension ONLY helps to fill in those details when adding addresses.

1. Open list orders page http://admin.stlpro.com/admin/products/order/, pick some order ids.

2. Open another page: http://admin.stlpro.com/products/getdsorders/, copy order ids from the previous page to the current page and click submit button.

    * This adds all orders info to the Chrome extension

    * Click on the extension icon, the admin can see the detail.

3. From Chrome Extension, the Admin can find the product URL, click on that and manually add products to the shopping cart.

4. From the Shopping Cart, click `Secure Checkout`

5. From the Adding Address, click on `multiple addresses` (this is only shown when there are more than one items)

6. The addresses popup is shown, click on Chrome Ext and click on `USE` button to automatically fill in client's address. One by One.

7. Then the admin go through the checkout + payment process as normal
